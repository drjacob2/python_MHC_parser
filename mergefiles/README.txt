Udpate: 09/05 I worked on taking the content from readintodic.py, which reads in the two files, and updating it to combine the files. Currently, trying to ensure that I insert unknown values for the introns spaces of the nuc file specific alleles. 

Update: 09/06 continuing to work on the files, clean up information and try to insert the intron information still. This is where I am having the most trouble. Working on a fix using a dictionary of dictionaries to match key/value information. 

readtodic0905_2.py- most current working doc
readtodic0905.py- contains alot of the trial and error content that didn't work out.
